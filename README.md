# Getting Started with Mobino

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## About Mobino

Mobino is a mobile online store developed with react
I have tried my best to show the best work I can
In this project, redux is used for state management
,react router dom is used for server side routing witch It
enables the creation of single-page web or mobile apps that
allow navigating without refreshing the page. It also allows
us to use browser history features while preserving the right application view.
i have used formik library to simplify the procces of making forms and ,
i have used react-icons library to use icons witch it delivers
the icons to your app as components so they're easier to work
with, and it lets you style them so they're consistent with
the overall style of your app.
